    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleksei.\n\n
        I love to cook, and I really love to listen death metal.\n
        My favorite dish is russian salad.\n
        Favorite band - Dead Can Dance.\n
        (I know, DCD is not a death metal band, but they are amazing, anyway)\n\n
        If I ate everything, that I can, and have nothing to listen, I like to roam somewhere, where I can see birds.\n\n
        I like to listen birds, not eat.
(the voices of magpies are similar for blast beats, you know)\n
